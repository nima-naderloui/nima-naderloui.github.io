I'm Nima, (Farsi: نیما). I'm a 2nd-year PhD student at the Computer Science and Eng. department of UConn, where I am advised by [Prof. Yuan Hong](https://yhongcs.github.io/) and a member of [DataSec Lab](https://yhongcs.github.io/people.html). 

I'm interested in deeply understanding how AI models behave and are applied in practice. I'm passionate about investigating the privacy and safety risks of AI systems, particularly those stemming from design choices, model behaviors, and deployment strategies. 

Right now, I’m all about digging into AI models🕵️‍♂️, finding what breaks, and uncovering hidden vulnerabilities that others might miss, but always curious and open to learning how to patch things up 🛠️ when needed. Please contact me if you had any ideas we can discuss!
